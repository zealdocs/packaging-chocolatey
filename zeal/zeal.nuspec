    <description>Zeal is an offline documentation browser inspired by [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash/), available for Linux and Windows.

      - Quickly search documentation using Alt+Space (or customised) hotkey to display Zeal from any place in your workspace.
      - Search in multiple sets of documentation at once.
      - Do not depend on your Internet connection.
      - Integrate Zeal with IDEA, Sublime Text, or your favourite IDE with a variety of [plugins](https://zealdocs.org/usage.html#plugins).</description>
